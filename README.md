# Matrix Rain Code - Made in P5.js

This is to have fun while learning p5.js. 

So, I thought about having my own matrix rain code implemented for a streaming channel that I own. And since it was too boring to make on After Effects, I've decided to make my own and include it on my repository.

The code is commented, so if you don't understand anything, please ask me! :)

Oh, btw: This code was made based on the tutorial at [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1TQCi9axzg). So give them aupport, because they deserve it!
